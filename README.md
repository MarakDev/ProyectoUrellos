# Urellos Proyect
Urellos is an exploration and horror game developed for Project 1 subject in the Video Game Design degree at the University of Burgos.

The game follows an elderly blind man who can only perceive his surroundings by using a clicking sound that emits a blue wave, revealing nearby objects. Meanwhile, he must escape from a monster that relentlessly pursues him across the map.

## How was made
This game was developed by a team of three people, with me serving as the programmer. We spent approximately four months working on the project. It was created entirely using Unity, C#, and Shader Graph.

## What I implemented
I implemented the monster's AI, a sonar system that reveals nearby physical objects, and a proximity-based audio system.
